/* Purpose of this program:
 - Usage of C style string. 
   const vs non-const string.
 
 - Modifiable string:
	char string[10];
	char string[] = "Helllo";
	These can be modified like string[0] = 'a';
 
 - String constant/literal: (This can't be modified)
	const char * str = "hello";
    const char str[] = "Hello";
 
 - Usage of setw
 
 - Usage of cin for getting a string.
 
 - char string[10]. here we can store 9 characters. at the end there is always null character. '\0'
 
 - char str[] = "Hello";
   const char str2[] = "Hello";
   char * str3 = "Hello";
   const char * str4 = "Hello";
   Here str is stored in a section which can is writeable. 
   str2, str3, str4 are stored in read-only sections. (Text section??)
   Can be verified by printing the addresses.
 
 - How to print the address in this situation (i.e how to print address of location where string is stored)
		const char * str = "HELLLO";
		std::cout << str << std::endl; // this will print complete string pointed to by str.
	but we want to print the address where HELLLO is stored.
	str is a pointer which contains address of HELLLO.
	so we just need to print whats inside str.
	in case of integer it simple.
	int a = 10;
	int * ptr = &a;
	std::cout << ptr << std::endl;
	this will print address of a.
	but this is not the case as we seen above in case of string.
	so what we need to do is to give cout a pointer of different type instead of char pointer.
	so lets give it void ptr. we need to convert char pointer to void and then give it to cout.
	std::cout << static_cast<void *>(str) << std::endl;
	this will print address where "HELLLO" is stored. so when void pointer is given to cout like int, it will print address inside.

#include <iostream>
#include <iomanip> // for setw. if not included, will get error 'no setw' in namespace std.

int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {
	
	char str[10]; // this is not constant string. just array of characters. so can be modified.
	
	std::cout << "Enter 9 or less characters : ";
	std::cin >> str; // '>>' operator considers space character as termination/null character?
	
	std::cout << str << std::endl; // keep sending characters to output until found null character or end of string.
	/* In  ^^^ statement, we are passing address of array str to cout. When address of a char array is passed to cout, cout will
	   not print address. it will print characters/string at that address.
	   so
	 std::cout << &str[0] << std::endl;
	 will print string as well instead of printing the address of the array. or address where this string is stored.
