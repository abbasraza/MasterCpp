/* Purpose of this program:
 - To find usage of reinterpret_cast.
 - Return a pointer to the same byte of memory, but just change the type of the pointer.
   (This is the same as what all pointer casts do in C, as explained above.)
 - For bit manipulation. where no calculation involved. just manipulation of address.
 - reinterpret_cast converts one pointer to another without changing the address, or converts
   between pointers and their numerical (integer) values.
 - reinterpret_cast says "Trust me, I know what I am doing. This looks totally wrong but it
   isn't. Just take these here bytes that you think are an X and treat them like a Y. It will be fine."
 - Templates:
   Problem with c-style casting: what if someone passes const int .
   template <class T>
   unsigned char* alias(T& x) {
		return (unsigned char*)(&x); ----> constness gone
   }
 
   c++: if someone passes const int
   template <class T>
   unsigned char* safe_alias(T& x) {
   return reinterpret_cast<unsigned char*>(&x); -----> error
   }
 - For opaque libraries. when static_cast doesn't work.
 
 - Compile time or runtime? TODO machine code / assembly difference?
