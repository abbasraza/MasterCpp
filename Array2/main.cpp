/* Purpose of this program:
 - Usage of 2D array (why called 2D?). Declare, define.
 - Practical use. Store marks of students in memory (1D) vs store marks of students along with their roll number
   in memory (2D). Consider it as an excel sheet. 1 coloumn for roll numbers and 1 column for marks. or 1 row for
   roll numbers and 1 row for marks.
   2dArray[NUMBER_OF_STUDENTS][FIELDS_PER_STUDENT]
 - Address of array.
 - Passing 2D array as function argument.
 - How elements of 2D array of integers are stored in memory. 1 row, then 2nd, then 3rd after that.
 - When array is passed as argument, and function modifies elements, it will reflect in original array.
