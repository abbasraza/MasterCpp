/* Purpose of this program:
 - Usage of array of strings.
 - What does array of strings mean? String is an array of characters. So 'array of strings' = array of 'array of characters'.
   i.e array of arrays. which is 2D array.
 - Difference between array of strings vs array of character pointers.
 - Constant strings
	---> const char * str[] = ..
	---> const char str[] = ..
    are stored in different section of program memory (Read-only/Text??).
