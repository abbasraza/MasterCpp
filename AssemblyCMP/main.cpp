 Purpose of this program: 
 - How comparison works
	if (number1 < number2)
 - It uses cmp instruction. It subtract one operand from other. how?
 
 - How assembly instruction cmp sets CF(Carry Flag) and SF(Sign Flag). How
 
 Breakpoint hit after cmp:
 
 Breakpoint 2, 0x0000000000400509 in main ()

 So we can see that after cmp has been executed, both CF=1, SF=1.
 
 
 
 4 - 5
 
 1st operand = 4 = 0000 0100
 2nd operand = 5 = 0000 0101
 
 So we have to perform
 
 1st operand
 - 2nd operand
 --------------
 
 
 7654 3210 <-- Bit number
 0000 0100
 - 0000 0101
 ------------
 
 Lets start.
 
 Bit 0 of 1st operand = 0
 Bit 0 of 2nd operand = 1
 
 so
 
 0
 - 1
 ===
 ?
 to do this,
 
 let's borrow a 1 from left side of bit 0 of 1st operand.
 
 so we see bit 2 of 1st operand is 1.
 
 when bit 2 is = 1, it means 4.
 
 we know that we can write 4 as 2 + 2. So we can write 4 as two 2s.
 
 7654 3210 <-- Bit number
 1
 1
 0000 0000
 - 0000 0101
 ------------
 So in above step, we have written bit 4 of 1st operand as two 2s (two 1 on top of bit 2 of 1st operand.)
 
 Now again as we know, a 2 can be written as two 1s. So we borrow one 1 from bit 1 of 1st operand and write two 1s on bit 0 of 1st operand.
 
 7654 3210 <-- Bit number
 1
 11
 0000 0000
 - 0000 0101
 ------------
 Now we are ready to perform subtraction on bit 0 and bit 1.
 
 7654 3210 <-- Bit number
 1
 11
 0000 0000
 - 0000 0101
 ------------
 11
 So after solving bit 0 and bit 1, lets see bit 2.
 
 We again see same problem.
 
 Bit 2 of 1st operand = 0
 
 Bit 2 of 2nd operand = 1
 
 to do this, let's borrow a 1 from left side of bit 2 of 1st operand.
 
 8 7654 3210 <-- Bit number
 1
 11
 1 0000 0000
 - 0000 0101
 ------------
 11
 Now you see, bit 8 of 1st operand is 1. We have borrowed this 1.
 
 At this stage, carry flag will be set. So CF=1.
 
 Now, if bit 8 is 1, it means 256.
 
 256 = 128 + 128
 
 if bit 7 is 1, it means 128. We can rewrite as
 
 8 7654 3210 <-- Bit number
 1       1
 1      11
 0000 0000
 - 0000 0101
 ------------
 11
 As previously, we can re-write it as:
 
 8 7654 3210 <-- Bit number
 1      1
 11     11
 0000 0000
 - 0000 0101
 ------------
 11
 As previously, we can re-write it as:
 
 8 7654 3210 <-- Bit number
 1     1
 111    11
 0000 0000
 - 0000 0101
 ------------
 11
 As previously, we can re-write it as:
 
 8 7654 3210 <-- Bit number
 1    1
 1111   11
 0000 0000
 - 0000 0101
 ------------
 11
 As previously, we can re-write it as:
 
 8 7654 3210 <-- Bit number
 1  1
 1111 1 11
 0000 0000
 - 0000 0101
 ------------
 11
 As previously, we can re-write it as:
 
 8 7654 3210 <-- Bit number
 1 1
 1111 1111
 0000 0000
 - 0000 0101
 ------------
 11
 At last we can solve this.
 
 Subtracting 2nd operand from all above it will give
 
 8 7654 3210 <-- Bit number
 1 1
 1111 1111
 0000 0000
 - 0000 0101
 ------------
 1111 1111
 
 
 So result = 1111 1111
 Notice, sign bit in result = bit 7 = 1
 
 so sign flag will be set. i.e SF=1
 
 And therefore SF=1, CF=1 after 4 - 5
