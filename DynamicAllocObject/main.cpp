/* Purpose of this program:
 - Dynamically allocating objects.
 - Destroying dynamically allocated objects.
 - new doesn't zero memory. whenever allocating memory using new, null/zero it.
 - If object of foo is allocated from heap using new, ctor should null any member pointers.
 - Any object allocated on stack (created inside function body, in arguments) will be automatically
   destroyed (by calling ctor) when it goes out of scope (i.e function exits)
 - Any object dynamically allocated (on heap) doesn't get automatically destroyed when going out of scope
   i.e when function exits. It should be freed/destroyed manually. by calling delete which calls dtor.
 - foo * f1 = new foo; This means member ptr will be null(if set if ctor) or contain garbage. i.e ptr
   doesn't point to any valid allocated memory yet.
 - foo * f2 = new foo(5,10);
   delete f2; // this means delete will not free memory pointed to by member ptr. should be freed in dtor.
