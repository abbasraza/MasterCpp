/* Purpose of this program:
 - Abstract class. Employee here is abstract because we never will create an object for this.
 - Usage of inheritance.
 - Scope resolution is required when we need to instruct compiler how to serve our call. i.e
   when there is a chance that compiler will get confused if we don't tell it.
