/**
 * This program demonstrates how to bind arguments to a function using std::bind from the functional library.
 * It defines a function called add that takes two integer arguments and returns their sum.
 * It then creates a new function called addFive that is a copy of the add function, but with the second argument fixed to the value 5.
 * The program calls the addFive function with the argument 10 and stores the result in a variable called result.
 * Finally, it outputs the result to the console.

    auto addFive = std::bind(add, std::placeholders::_1, 5);

    /*
    Here, std::placeholders::_1 is a placeholder that represents the first argument of the add function.
    By binding the second argument of add to the value 5, we create a new function addFive that takes a single integer argument and returns the sum of that argument and 5.

    We can then call addFive with a single argument to produce a result:

    // call the addFive function with the argument 10 and store the result in a variable called result
    int result = addFive(10); // result is 15

    // output the result to the console
    std::cout << result << std::endl;
