/* Purpose of this program:
 - Introduction to inheritance.

 - Private and public inheritance.

 - Use of protected data member. can be accessed by derived class but not by public.

 - Data & functions of Base which can be accessed directly (using dot operator)
	- Inside:
		Base --> all
		Derived --> all except private
	- By Objects of:
		Base and Publicly derived class --> only public
		Privately derived class --> none
 
 - When we derive a class from Base, the Base class says to derived:
 - You can't access my private data directly.
 - You can use my no argument ctor. ??? TODO wrong see Inheritance2
 - (public inheritance): Your objects can only access my public stuff directly.
 - (private inheritance): Your objects cannot access any of my stuff directly.

 - If derived (no matter public or private) class doesn't have a no argument ctor, the ctor of Base is called when object of
   derived class is created. ?? TODO wrong. see Inheritance2
