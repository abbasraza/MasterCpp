/* Purpose of this program:
 - Introduction to inheritance.
 
 - Here:
	D = derived
	B = base

 - Private and public inheritance.

 - Use of protected data member. can be accessed by D class but not by public.

 - Data & functions of B which can be accessed directly (using dot operator)
	- Inside class:
		B --> all
		D --> all except private
	- By Objects of:
		B and Publicly D class --> only public
		Privately D class --> none
 
 - When we derive a class from B, the B class says to D:
 - You can't access my private data directly.
 - You can use my no argument ctor. ??? TODO wrong see Inheritance2
 - (public inheritance): Your objects can only access my public stuff directly.
 - (private inheritance): Your objects cannot access any of my stuff directly.

 - If D (no matter public or private) class doesn't have a no argument ctor, the ctor of B is called when object of
   D class is created. ?? TODO wrong. see Inheritance2
 
 - class CountDown : Counter
   {
   }
   This means private inheritance.
 
 - When to use private inheritance? : when hiding B completely from D's objects.
