/* Purpose of this program:
 - ctor and inheritance.
 - To create a child, first a parent will be created then child.
 - Here:
	D = derived
	B = base

 - When a D object is created:
   1) The ctor of D is called.
   2) 
       i)  If there is a ctor of B specified in initializer list of ctor of D, then that ctor of B will be called.
       OR
       ii) Otherwise default no-arg ctor of B will be called. If there is no default no-arg ctor in B (implicit or
		   user defined), then it will create problem.
   3) ctor of B (whichever from step 2) is executed.
   4) ctor of D is executed.

 - D shouldn't modify data of B directly. Should be done via calling appropriate ctor of B in D.
   D ctor can't initialize B members in initializer list. Instead should call appropriate B ctor 
   in initializer list of D's ctor.

 - D doesn't inherit ctor from B.
