/* Purpose of this program:
 - Levels of inheritance.
    ----------
   | Employee |
    ----------
	     ^
	     |
	     |
    -----------
   | Scientist |
    -----------
	     ^
	     |
	     |
  ----------------
 | ChiefScientist |
  ----------------

 - How public and private inheritance work with levels. if Outer is private ( B below),
   inner becomes private if not (A below). If inner is private (A below) and outer is public
   (B below), inner remains private.
 ==========================================================================
 class A
 {
 }
 class B : public A
 {
 }
 class C : public B
 {
 }
 
 Inside B: You can access public/protected of A.
 Inside C: You can access pub/prot of B & A.
 Object of C: Can access pub of B and A.
 ==========================================================================
 class A
 {
 }
 class B : private A  // A is private of B. C won't be able to see it directly.
 {
 }
 class C : public B
 {
 }
 
 Inside B: You can access public/protected of A.
 Inside C: You can access pub/prot of B. Not of A.
 Object of C: Can access pub of B. not of A.
 ==========================================================================
 class A
 {
 }
 class B : public A
 {
 }
 class C : private B // B and A become private of C
 {
 }
 
 Inside B: You can access public/protected of A.
 Inside C: You can access pub/prot of B and A.
 Object of C: Cannot access pub of B, nor A.
 ==========================================================================
 class A
 {
 }
 class B : private A
 {
 }
 class C : private B
 {
 }
 
 Inside B: You can access public/protected of A.
 Inside C: You can access pub/prot of B but not A.
 Object of C: Cannot access pub of B, nor A.
 ==========================================================================
 
 - Here we can do 
 
 class chiefScientist : private Scientist, Employee
 {
 }
 
 But it would be wrong. ChiefScientist will be containing then 2 copies of Employee,
 1 from Scientist and other from Employee.
