/**
 * @brief This program demonstrates the use of unique pointers and how to get a raw pointer from a unique pointer.
 * 
 * A unique pointer is a smart pointer that owns and manages the object it points to.
 * It ensures that the object is deleted when the unique pointer goes out of scope.
 * This program creates a unique pointer to an object of MyClass and sets its member variable i to 10.
 * It then gets a raw pointer from the unique pointer and sets its member variable i to 15.
 * The program then deletes the object using the raw pointer, which causes a double free error
 * because the object is already deleted when the unique pointer goes out of scope.
