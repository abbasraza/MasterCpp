/* Purpose of this program:
 - Usage of dynamic memory allocation with new and delete.
 - new vs malloc . we don't need casting with new.
 - new will throw bad_alloc exception if memory allocation failed.
   if exception is not handled, program will crash. To avoid exception,
   place (std::nothrow) between new and type. Now new will return null pointer
   if memory allocation fails.
 - delete frees memory. but doesn't null pointer. so null pointer after delete.
