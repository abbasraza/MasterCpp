/* Purpose of this program:
 - Usage of operator overloading.
 - Unary operator overloading (++, --). prefix and postfix('int' used to tell compiler. Not an argument.).
 - Functions that differ only in their return type cannot be overloaded.
 - Aliases (references) and pointers. int& alias = *ptr;
 - Returning reference to original object from a function.
 - Reference don't change once initialized. Unlike pointers which can be re-pointed to something different.
 - Here prefix and postfix doesn't make much difference. like we can't differentiate between postfix and prefix.
   However if we return a copy instead of alias of original object, then we can see difference. Because
	return Counter(count++); ---> new object will be returned with old counter value.
	is different from
	return Counter(++count); ---> new object will be returned with increamented counter value.
