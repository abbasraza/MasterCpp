 1) pointer to int 									--> int * ptr1 = &var;
 2) pointer to const int							--> const int * ptr2 = &var_const; or const int * ptr2 = &var;
 3) const pointer to int							--> int * const ptr3 = &var;

 5) pointer to (pointer to int)						--> int ** ptr5 = &ptr1;

 10) const pointer to (pointer to const int)		--> const int ** const ptr10 = &ptr2;
 11) const pointer to (const pointer to int)		--> int * const * const ptr11 = &ptr3;
 12) const pointer to (const pointer to const int)	--> const int * const * const ptr12 = &ptr4;
 
 13) Conversion between single pointers listed above: (From 1 to 4)
 --------------------------------------------------------------
 Rule:
 ====
 a)
 pointer to int = pointer to const int; // won't work. need const cast. actual int shouldn't be constant.
 pointer to x = const pointer x; //works
 const pointer to x = pointer to x; //works
 
 b) rest works fine.
 
  1 = 1,3		--> can do this
  1 = 2,4		--> can't do this. need const cast
  2 = 1,2,3,4	--> can do this
  3 = 1,3 		--> can
  3 = 2,4 		--> cant. need const cast
  4 = 1,2,3,4 	--> can

 SEE 'ConstCast' FOR EXPLICIT CONVERSIONS

 Conversion between double pointers listed above: (From 5 to 12)
 ---------------------------------------------------------------
 Rule:
 ====
 a) lvalue inner pointer has same type as rvalue inner pointer
 OR
 {
 b) pointer to constant pointer to constant int = any
 AND
 c) pointer to constant pointer to int = pointer to pointer to int
 }
 d) (outer most constant pointer) can be converted to (outer most non-constant pointer).
 e) (outer most non constant pointer) can be converted to (outer most constant pointer).

 
 5 = &1 --> true;
 6 = &2	--> true;
 7 = &1, &3 --> true;
 8 = &1, &2, &3, &4 --> true;
 9 = &1 --> true;
 10 = &2 --> true;
 11 = &1, &3 --> true;
 12 = &1, &2, &3, &4 --> true;

 
 5 = 7 --> cant work. need casting --> int ** ptrt = const_cast<int**>(ptr7);
 5 = 5,9 --> it means 5 = 9 works.
 6 = 6,10 --> it means 6 = 10 works.
 7 = 5,7,9,11 --> it means 7 = 7 works. and 7 = 9 works and 7 = 11 works.
 8 = ALL 5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12 --> all conversions work
 9 = 5,9 --> can
 10 = 6,10 --> can
 11 = 5,7,9,11 --> can
 12 = ALL 5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12 --> all conversions work

 ############### Final Rules and Conclusions: ###############
 ############################################################
 
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 - Single pointer:
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 ###Rule for implicit conversion:
 pointer to int = &var_const; // won't work. need const cast. actual int shouldn't be constant.
 this can be put as --> pointer to int = pointer to const int; // won't work. need const cast. actual int shouldn't be constant.
 ####Conclusion of explicit conversion using const_cast:
 we need explicit conversion (const_cast) to remove integer constness from a (single pointer to const int).
 But it will work SAFELY only if actual object is not constant as below
 
 int v = 10
 const int * ptr1 = &v1
 int * ptr2 = const_cast<int *>(ptr1)
 
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 - Double pointer:
 ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 ###Rule for implicit conversion:
 a) lvalue inner pointer has same type as rvalue inner pointer
 OR
 {
 b) pointer to constant pointer to constant int = any
 AND
 c) pointer to constant pointer to int = pointer to pointer to int
 }
 d) (outer most constant pointer) can be converted to (outer most non-constant pointer).
 e) (outer most non constant pointer) can be converted to (outer most constant pointer).
 ####Conclusion of explicit conversion using const_cast:
 1) we can remove constness of int. (SAFELY only if actual int is non constant)
 2) we can add constness to int.
 3) we can remove constness of inner pointer.
 4) we can add constness to inner pointer.
