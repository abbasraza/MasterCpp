/* this will generate a seg fault because we are using the same iterator after erase
    When we erase the last element 5; the vector end changes. 
    lets say vector end was at address 5 previously
    now we erase last element
    vector end will be at address 4 now
    then we ++it
    so it will point to address 6 now
    ANDD in for loop condition, 6 ! = 4
    ++it
    this will go forever

        It provides a way to indicate the "one-past-the-end" position in the vector.

            When you erase elements from a vector using the erase function, the vector's size is reduced,
            and the elements after the erased elements are shifted to fill the gap left by the removed elements.
            As a result, both begin() and end() iterators are affected by the erasure.
