/* Purpose of this program:
 - when and how to use static cast.
 - http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/language/static_cast
 - When:
	1) in standard Implicit conversions. Done by compiler automatically.
	2) in Explicit conversion between artihmetic types. (calculation involved)
	3) reverse of standard implicit conversions.
		int i;
		void * ptr = &f; // standard implicit conversion
		int * ptr = static_cast<int*>(ptr); // reverse of standard implicit conversion
	4) Templates: overloaded functions.
	5) Inheritance: Unsafe conversion between derived classes.
		 struct P {
		 int m = 0;
			void hello() const {
				std::cout << "Hello world, this is P!\n";
			}
		 };
		 struct C : P {
			void hello() const {
			std::cout << "Hello world, this is C!\n";
			}
		 };

		 // static downcast
		 C c;
		 P& pr = c; // upcast via implicit conversion
		 pr.hello();
		 C& another_c = static_cast<C&>(pr); // downcast
		 another_c.hello();
 
		 Hello world, this is P!
		 Hello world, this is C!


		***Assume**** that the P* points to a P that is part of a C object; don't bother performing a check. Adjust the address of the pointer if necessary so that it will point to the C object.
